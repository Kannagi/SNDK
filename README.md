# SNDK
SDK for SNES with Higueul language  
It is an SDK that aims to have an efficient compilation.  
You can have a code as quickly with higueul as by writing it in full asm.  
While having a "C-like" syntax.  

SDK is in stable version 0.3   
To test please download : https://github.com/Kannagi/SNDK/releases/tag/version_stable_v0_35
And launch `higueulc`   
For more details please read the wiki.  

You can learn Higueulc, by reading the example source code, but it has some difference with C, so I advise you to read the wiki :
